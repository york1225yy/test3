sns_exp is exposure_line

minimum value of sc4336p:
again ---  1024
dgain ---  1024
isp_dgain ---  256


Run step:
1. Run ./sample_fast_ae 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2. Exit the sample after AE is stable and prinf parameter of AE.
3. Run the sample with the last parameter of AE.
4. Observe the exposure effect.

Attention:
1.The gain and the exposure must correspond.
2.The exposure should correspond to the environment, and AE is stable in first three frames.
3.Only support for sc4336p
